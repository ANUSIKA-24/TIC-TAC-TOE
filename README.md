# TIC-TAC-TOE
This tic tac toe game was one of my minor projects based on java programming language that I did while in diploma final year, this is basically a version of tic tac toe game but just in a digital version that can be carried anywhere.
This game is played between two players as everyone knows.This game can be played for maximum 1 minute. It means that winner can be declared within a minute of time.To win this game, a player must place three of their mark in horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.Also, this game requires Strategy, Tactics and Observation skills.
In this game we have programmed the players as Player X and Player 0.Players can write their corresponding scores in the space provided to them.The winning message will be declared in the bar given just after the TIC TAC TOE box.And after the completion of a game, player can reset the game and play again.And in case players are willing to play later can exit from the game using the exit option.The rules of the games are same as the offline one. One player can choose his box only once and it is unchangeable after player's turn.

unfortunately, the source code was lost from backups of my drive somehow,but had a documentation still available, therefore I'm uploading that for the reference.
